* JitHub is an application that saves your contacts and helps you schedule meetings through cross-checking the
timetable of your group mates.
* JitHub is a CLI (Command Line Interface) application with GUI output so that you can have best of the both worlds.
* JitHub is a Java application that you can run on any machine with Java Runtime Environment installed.
* The original addressbook application provides a *reasonably well-written* code example. We hope we don't screw it up.
* What's different from the original https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4[Addressbook]:
** Meeting scheduling [coming in v1.4]
** Add to-do tasks
** Natural language processing
** Auto complete for commands
** Export contacts
