== PROJECT: JitHub

== Overview

JitHub is a desktop personal assistant application that allows students to manage their contacts, schedule and to-do tasks. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 15 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to create a to-do task*
** What it does: allows the user to create to-do tasks.
** Justification: This feature improves the usability of the product significantly because a user can create a to-do task to remind them the to-dos of the day.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: JavaMail, CalendarFx

* *Minor enhancement*: added a calendar view where users can view their schedules, enhancing the overall user interface.
