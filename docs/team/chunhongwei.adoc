== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added *the ability to view available meeting time slots in teams.*
** What it does: It allows you to view the available meeting time slots based on the calendar of all team members
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as it enables you to arrange for group meetings without
manually checking each team member's calendar.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects GUI to be added in future. It required an in-depth
analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in
the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
