== Overview

`JitHub` is a desktop meeting organising application targeted at tertiary students. Besides enabling you to view common
meeting time slots in teams, it includes various meeting tools such as the taking of minutes and a list of todo tasks.
This is done with a Command Line Interface(CLI), and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
 `JitHub` is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

JitHub is developed in a team of five throughout the course of a semester as part of module requirements in the School
of Computing, National University of Singapore.

Modules with JitHub as requirements:

* CS2101 - Effective Communication for Computing Professionals
* CS2113T - Software Engineering & Object Oriented Programming

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added *the ability to view available meeting time slots in teams.*
** What it does: It allows you to view the available meeting time slots based on the calendar of all team members
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as it enables you to arrange for group meetings without
manually checking each team member's calendar.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects GUI to be added in future, should the calendar be displayed with a non-text format.
 It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes
 to existing commands.
