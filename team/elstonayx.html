<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>: Added a wrong command suggestion when the user types in a wrong command and presses enter.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: When a wrong command is being typed and the <code>ENTER</code> key is pressed, the system would find a most
similar command available in the AddressBook.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This helps the user understand what went wrong and what command could have been typed instead.</p>

<h3 id="getting-smart-suggestions"><a class="link" href="#getting-smart-suggestions">Getting Smart Suggestions</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Receive smart suggestions while typing in your commands. Press the <code>TAB</code> key while typing a command halfway to get
suggestions on possible commands without having to navigate to the help window. If only one command is available,
pressing <code>TAB</code> will auto-complete the command for you without the need to type it in manually.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is particularly helpful when you are new to the commands and require time to get used to it. Pressing <code>TAB</code> would
show all helpful and useful information needed, and this would definitely benefit you as the learning curve to using our
application would not be steep.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Examples:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>While typing <code>his</code> to get <code>history</code> command, press <code>TAB</code>. The <code>history</code> command will automatically be filled in for
you as it is the only suggestion available. The command parameters would then be shown as a prompt to help you with your
input.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While typing <code>e</code>, press <code>TAB</code>. The system will suggest to you all possible commands that start with <code>e</code>, which would
be <code>exportall</code>, <code>export</code>, <code>exit</code>, and <code>edit</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<h3 id="getting-wrong-command-suggestions"><a class="link" href="#getting-wrong-command-suggestions">Getting Wrong Command Suggestions</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Should you type in a wrong command, fear not, as our system will automatically suggest to you what you have typed wrongly,
by giving you a closest approximation of word through the message box after you press enter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The input is not case sensitive when looking for suggestions, hence it would increase the chance of getting a closer approximation of your
desired command!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is particularly useful when you are typing very quickly, as sometimes you might make minor mistakes which can be
easily correctable from our application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Examples:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you wanted to type <code>select</code> but you typed <code>salect</code> instead, the system will tell you that it is an invalid command,
and would suggest to you the command <code>select</code> instead.</p>

<h3 id="suggestions-feature"><a class="link" href="#suggestions-feature">Suggestions Feature</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The suggestions feature gives users helpful suggestions on what command to type, and corrections for commands when incorrect
commands are being entered.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="current-implementation"><a class="link" href="#current-implementation">Current Implementation</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two instances when suggestions are given.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Firstly, when a user completes entering a command (after pressing <code>ENTER</code> key), if the command typed is invalid, such as
commands being misspelt, the system will suggest a similar command based on the edit distance (which will be explained later).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second instance would be when the user presses tab while typing the command halfway. The system will suggest commands
based on the current prefix string. If only a single command is available, the command would be completed for the user,
and the system would show the parameters required for that command.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="wrong-command-suggestion"><a class="link" href="#wrong-command-suggestion">Wrong Command Suggestion</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given below is an example usage of how the WrongCommandSuggestion behaves at each step.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 1: The user would type in a misspelt command string into the Command Box pane.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 2: The command would be parsed into the AddressBookParser class. Since no commands match the word exactly, it would
fall into the default case.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 3: The default case would extract out only the command portion of the user input, and input it into the
WrongCommandSuggestion class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 4: WrongCommandSuggestion would then instantiate the StringSimilarity class to find the nearest match of a word.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 5: editDistance in StringSimliarity class would be called to find out the edit distance between two words. These two
words would be the wrong command the user has input, and the list of available commands in the whole application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 6: WrongCommandSuggestion would then compare if the edit distance of the current command is shorter than the current
shortest edit distance command (which is initialised to 5 edits). If it is shorter, it would then suggest the current command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 7: WrongCommandSuggestion would then return the suggestion in a string, which would then be inputted into the CommandException,
to be thrown to the LogicManager class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following sequence diagram shows an example of how the WrongCommandSuggestion operation works with
misspelt command "histary" (closest command is <code>history</code>):</p>

<h5 id="input-command-suggestion"><a class="link" href="#input-command-suggestion">Input Command Suggestion</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given below is an example of how the InputCommandSuggestion behaves at each step.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 1: Upon instantiation of CommandBox during the program instantiation phase, CommandBox will create an instance of
InputCommandSuggestion, which will create a Trie containing all the commands available in the application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 2: When the user presses <code>TAB</code> after entering a command, CommandBox will call method <code>handleTabPressed()</code> to fetch
the current input that the user has typed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 3: <code>handleTabPressed()</code> method will then call the <code>getSuggestedCommands()</code> method in InputCommandSuggestion, while
inputting the user&#8217;s input into the parameters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 4: The InputCommandSuggestion would then find available commands using the Trie class and determine whether there
are any other possible combinations of commands with the current string of words.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 5: The Trie class would then return a list of commands available, which would then pass back to CommandBox.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 6a: If there is only one command available, CommandBox would auto-complete the current input with the valid command,
then request for the Command Parameters through the InputCommandSuggestion class. It would then pass the string to be
posted on EventsCenter, so that the Command Parameters would be displayed on the results panel.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 6b: If there are multiple commands available, CommandBox will pass all the possible commands to EventsCenter, to
output all possible commands available with the current string.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following sequence diagram shows an example of how the InputCommandSuggestion class works:</p>

<h4 id="design-considerations"><a class="link" href="#design-considerations">Design Considerations</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the WrongCommandSuggestion implementation, there were multiple design considerations while implementing the feature.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1:</strong> Compare the input command and the actual command character by character and see
which command has the most matches.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Easy to implement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Not as accurate or reliable in terms of giving a correct match of command.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2 (current choice):</strong> Use a string matching algorithm to implement the matching and difference
calculation between the command and the user input.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Accurate prediction or suggestions from actual commands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Difficult to implement, and might require more processing overhead.</p>

<p>For the InputCommandSuggestion implementation, there were multiple design considerations while implementing the feature.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1:</strong> While the user types, command suggestions would be given continuously with regards
to the user&#8217;s input.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Makes it more convenient for typing in commands as there is immediate response of the correctness of the command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage, complicated to implement, and requires a lot of work on
the UI for the application.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2 (current choice):</strong> When the user requires corrections to the command or requires feedback, press <code>TAB</code>
key to receive suggestions given by the system.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Less overhead to the system as the system does not have to constantly run the algorithm to check for valid and
available commands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Feedback is less responsive, and requires additional keys for users to press.</p>
